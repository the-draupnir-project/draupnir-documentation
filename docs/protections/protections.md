# Protections

Protections are plugins or individual modules that work with
Draupnir's protected rooms and the management room.

You can find a list of available protections by using the
`!draupnir protections` command.

Several protections are enabled by default, as almost all of
Draupnir's core functionality is implemented using the protection
system.
