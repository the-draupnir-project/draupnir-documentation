This is an overview of Draupnir protections, for a more indepth (but
still friendly) explanation, please view [this
page](./matrix-protection-suite/concepts/protection).

# Protections

Protections are plugins or individual modules that work with
Draupnir's protected rooms and the management room.

You can find a list of available protections by using the
`!draupnir protections` command.

Please also see the sidebar, or the [protections
category](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/category/protections),
in this documentation site to see the list of protections that have a
dedicated documentation page.

Several protections are enabled by default, as almost all of
Draupnir's core functionality is implemented using the protection
system.
