# Longhouse consultation

The _longhouse assembly_ may consult the _contribution guild_ with a request to
fix a specific bug or implement a feature at any time.

Consultations may take place within
[Draupnir - Contribution Guild Consultation](https://matrix.to/#/!HMEUBVghQjScFABjfW:matrix.org/%24k7hteExVxh5ve-LZd0VsU7efWqKriW21k3dokC_Nsdw?via=matrix.org&via=asgard.chat).

They must follow the template:

```
#### Request

I would like the feature from issue #123 to be considered.

#### Why

Our moderation team is struggling without this feature at the moment.
```

These consultations may still happen informally and jump directly to the
presentation step if a contributor has agreed.
