## Longhouse cycle presentation

The Longhouse cycle presentation starts with an evaluation by the _contributors
guild_ of the direction of the draupnir project and any progress made in the
current cycle, including an estimation of when work from the current cycle will
be finished.

Then individual proposals relevant to the session will be sent seeking for the
_longhouse assembly_ to voice opinion on each individual proposal.
