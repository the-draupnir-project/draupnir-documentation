# The Draupnir longhouse cycle

Draupnir's long-term decisions and regular development is conducted through a
cyclic process.

### Consultation

Consultation is an ambient rotating process that is always open. When
consultation for the current session ends. Consultation for the next session
remains open until the current session is over and the selection process for the
next session has begun to take place.

See [longhouse consultation](./longhouse-consultation.md).

### Selection

The _contribution guild_ reviews issues and creates plans from the triage
process as part of their regular work. They select which plans to present to the
longhouse assembly, with consideration from the current consultation session.
The beginning of this process rotates the consultation session.

The _contribution guild_ will only select options that are within material
constraints. Members of the assembly may pledge material support against options
as part of the consultation process.

### Presentation

The _contribution guild_ presents a document that discusses the results and
progress towards the priorities decided in the previous session. Alongside this,
the _contribution guild_ forms a document with opinions for each option within
the context of the current state of development.

See [longhouse presentation](./longhouse-presentation.md).

### Choice

The longhouse assembly votes on the presentation, either affirming a decision
made by the _contribution guild_ with a consensus or voting on the options.

Objections may be raised at anytime about any of the options and these can be
discussed.

### Development

Once the session is over, work begins on the decided outcome. The outcome is
recorded in a log.
