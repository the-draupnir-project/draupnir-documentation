# Governance inspiration and resources

<!-- cspell:ignore Neugebauer -->

Here are some of the resources that we used or inspired us to create this
governance system. If you are trying to create something similar, don't fret, it
takes time and you need to think about it for awhile.

- The Death of Consequences - Christopher Neugebauer
  https://2025.pycon.org.au/program/7XVERX/.

- Dawn Foster's introductory governance blog series:

- Stealing ideas from https://www.cncf.io/ (note: this is corporatist
  governance).
