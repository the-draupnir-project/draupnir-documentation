# 2025-10-A: Longhouse Cycle Review

_The purpose of this review is to formally close off the prior cycle of work and
communicate progress or changes in direction to the wider community._

TODO: Surely the selection presentation needs to be a part of this to affirm the
direction change? idk.

## Overview

TODO: Link new planning system This was a short cycle to trial the new planning
system and prepare for Draupnir's first official longhouse cycle.

## Completed work

_A link to or a list of tasks that were completed._

## Uncompleted work

_Any work still in progress or placed back into the backlog and why._

## Direction

_A statement on the project priorities, sometimes it is valid to close a cycle
early to change direction entirely, this may happen naturally and unannounced at
first, and the formal change comes later and announced here_

## Findings and challenges

_Anything that has been learnt during the cycle in any aspect, planning,
governance, programming, triaging, issues_

## Recommendations

_Any recommendations or ideas for change that could be acted upon_.
