# 2025-10-A: Longhouse Cycle Review

## Overview

_written by @Gnuxie_

Milestone: https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/planning/milestone/1

It's become clear to me that I need to feel closer to draupnir users in order to
continue effective development of the project. And to achieve this, I've worked
to create new governance and planning changes for the project. With the primary
aim of giving draupnir users control over the project direction. And a way to
affirm contributors for the work being done.

As a part of this, development conducted by the _root contribution circle_ will
now take place over cycles that aren't bounded by time. Cycles are used to work
on iterations of work and report back to the community on the results. Adding
accountability between core contributors and users. This is done in a way that
explicitly preserves voluntary association in both directions.

## Direction

<!-- Cspell:ignore NLnet -->

The longer context of this is that the goals of the
[NLnet grant](https://marewolf.me/posts/draupnir/24-nlnet-goals.html) were
designed when I was less experienced at project management, and this meant that
the roadmap was effectively rigid. This meant that we were opportunistically at
a major disadvantage. To adapt the roadmap to changes in circumstance, such as
the need for homeserver admin tools earlier in the year, and project hydra
itself, meant putting NLnet work on hold. Additionally, we didn't have a
mechanism to receive affirmation or support for the decisions that we made to
suspend that work. And I think that such a mechanism is needed because I crashed
out a number of times. Draupnir is not just some personal project, it is an
obligation and this work is responsible for the continuance of _a lot_ of
communities.

The [NLnet grant](https://marewolf.me/posts/draupnir/24-nlnet-goals.html) itself
will be expiring in December. And for full transparency I have received around
€9.7k in total from NLnet to support development that has been going on for well
over a year. This has been my main income, and only income outside of my ko-fi
and GitHub sponsors, since 2022, and this has allowed me to develop Draupnir as
a primary occupation. I'm incredibly grateful for the grant, but I need to make
clear that this is a grant that kept Draupnir afloat and there has to be a more
sustainable solution for the project. In addition, I have mostly supported this
work with savings I made from my from prior jobs and living as frugally as a
student, at great sacrifice to myself.

Therefore it's desirable to close off some milestones before the grant expires
so that development can continue into 2026. And this will mean putting project
hydra mitigation (room upgrade support) on hold.

The aim of the governance rework that has taken place is simply to confirm that
the work being done on this project is valuable to its users.

## Completed work this cycle

_Note: this isn't all work that has been completed, this section just relates to
the goals of the cycle_.

- Entirely new [governance documentation](../governance.md) for the project.

- A news reader in Draupnir to inform end users about development progress and
  updates.

- A new [planning](../../contributing/planning.md) system has been designed to
  support open decision making. It's not entirely new, but more documenting and
  formalising the system that was already in use, then revising it a couple of
  times.

- A new Matrix space to facilitate feedback and governance participation, called
  [the Draupnir longhouse](https://matrix.to/#/%23the-draupnir-longhouse:matrix.org).
