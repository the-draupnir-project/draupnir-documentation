# 2025-10-A: Longhouse Cycle Review

## Overview

_written by @Gnuxie_

It's become clear to me that I need to feel closer to draupnir users in order to
continue effective development of the project. And to achieve this, I've worked
to create new governance and planning changes for the project. With the primary
aim of giving draupnir users control over the project direction.

As a part of this, development will now take place over cycles that aren't
bounded by time. Cycles are used to work on iterations of work and report back
to the community on the results. Adding accountability between core contribution
and users. However, the association remains voluntary in both directions.

## Completed work

- Entirely new [governance documentation](../governance.md) for the project.

- A news reader in Draupnir to inform end users about development progress and
  updates.

- A new [planning](../../contributing/planning.md) system has been designed to
  support open decision making. It's not entirely new, but more documenting and
  formalising the system that was already in use, then revising it a couple of
  times.

- A new Matrix space to facilitate feedback and governance participation, called
  [the Draupnir longhouse](https://matrix.to/#/%23the-draupnir-longhouse:matrix.org).
