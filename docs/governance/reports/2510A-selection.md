# 2025-10-A-Selection: Selection

## Context

In the [current cycle](./2510A-cycle-review.md) we have been making changes to
give draupnir users more control in the project's direction.

## Options

As per [the longhouse cycle](../longhouse-cycle.md) process, the _contribution
guild_ will only select options within material constraints. Members of the
assembly may pledge material support against options as part of the
[_consultation_](../longhouse-consultation.md) process. Contributors retain the
right of self determination as contribution is a voluntary process.

You SHOULD read the context of the selection before voting. See the
[cycle review](./2510A-cycle-review.md).

### Option A: Policy room subscription preview (root contributor circle endorsed)

This would mean changing the policy room watch command to preview the effects of
all protections when subscribing to the room.
[Milestone for the cycle](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/planning/milestone/2).

### Option B: Continue with room upgrade support for Hydra

This would mean incrementing towards full room upgrade management by
implementing
[MSC4321](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4321) in its
entirety. See
[project hydra mitigation](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/planning/issues/44).

### None of the above

This is an expression of no confidence in the direction.
