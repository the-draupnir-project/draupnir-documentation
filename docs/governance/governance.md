# Governance

Governance is essential to any project that has responsibilities and obligations
to other parties. While the open source software movement have relied on
licenses alone to organise their projects. This is only really suitable for
projects that exist as libraries where the consumers are primarily developers.
Draupnir is a project that has no direct business that can sustain the project.
Draupnir therefore needs a formal governance system. Please also see the project
[vision](../contributing/vision.md).

## The Draupnir Longhouse

Draupnir's long term decisions are made through a process called the _Draupnir
longhouse_. This process is cyclic and happens in _sessions_. There are five
stages to each session, and all of the interaction is lightweight and
asynchronous.

Short term decisions can also be made through the longhouse, but these happen
outside of the cycle. For example, irregular contributors may wish to present to
the longhouse assembly for affirmation.
