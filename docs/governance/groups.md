## The longhouse contribution guild

The contribution guild allows contributors themselves to present the work they
feel able to do to the longhouse. This process allows contributors to seek
affirmation from the longhouse for future work. They may provide a choice to the
longhouse as a part of that, if the contributor feels there are multiple
pathways forward. Implicitly, this allows the longhouse assembly to voice the
direction of the project without any contributor feeling like they are working
for the assembly.

All Draupnir contributors are automatically associated with the contribution
guild. And only they can assess their own capability to contribute for the next
session and use that knowledge to present proposals for future work.

## The longhouse assembly

The longhouse assembly are all of draupnir's interested parties and users.
