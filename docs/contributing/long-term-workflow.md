# Long term workflow

:::info

For an overview of planning, please see [planning](./planning.md).

:::

In order to devise long term plans, the-draupnir-project uses a planning system.

## Where can I find Draupnir's plans?

Draupnir's plans are kept within the
[planning issue tracker](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/planning/issues).
This is a separate github repository that holds Draupnir's plans.

## Finding issues which may need planning

Once issues have been [triaged](./triaging), it is possible to view a list of
issues that are the most painful to the project in this
[project view](https://github.com/orgs/the-draupnir-project/projects/5/views/8).
