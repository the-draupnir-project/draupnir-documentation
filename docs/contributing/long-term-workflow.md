# Long term workflow

In order to devise long term plans, the-draupnir-project uses a planning system.

## Where can I find Draupnir's plans?

Draupnir's plans are kept within the
[planning issue tracker](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/planning/issues).
This is a separate github repository that holds Draupnir's plans.

## How are plans structured?

Draupnir's plans are usually comprised of user stories. Which may be collected
into an Epic. The system is adhoc, but should be familiar to anyone who has
engaged with project management in software development.

User stories are a description of how to solve a problem or implement a feature
for a specific actor. They usually derive a solution for issues found in the
draupnir repository.

Alongside stories, tasks may also be documented. Which are just descriptions of
a unit of work that can be implemented.

## Finding issues which may need planning

Once issues have been [triaged](./triaging), it is possible to view a list of
issues that are the most painful to the project in this
[project view](https://github.com/orgs/the-draupnir-project/projects/5/views/8).
